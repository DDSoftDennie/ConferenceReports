     * A system that allows for more complex decision making by allowing NPC's to plan their actions based on goals.
  * **HTN**: Hierarchical Task Network
     * A system that allows for more complex decision making by allowing NPC's to plan their actions based on tasks.
  * **Direct AI**: A system that allows for more complex decision making by allowing NPC's to plan their actions based on direct input from the player.
