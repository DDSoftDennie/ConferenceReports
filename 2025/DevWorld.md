## How can I trust you? AI and the leap of faith

### Speaker: Lan Chu

### Category: AI

### Notes

* In AI, the most important and difficult thing is **EVALUATION**

  * Normal (old school) software is deterministic
    * Same input, same output
* Define exact goals for testing accuracy
  * It's about what is means good, and if the answer is a good result
* Things to measure:
  * **Relevance**: Is the answer relevant to the question?
  * **Factual consistency**: Is the answer factually correct?
  * **Reasoning quality**: Does the answer show good reasoning?
  * **Source relevance**: Are the sources used relevant to the question?
* AI to judge AI:
  * Use AI to evaluate the answers of AI
  * **AI can be used to evaluate AI**
  * Within prompts
  * Between different models
* Human-AI alignment
